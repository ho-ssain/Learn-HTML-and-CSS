          Three <em>fundamental</em> technologies‚ÄîHTML, CSS, and JavaScript‚Äîare
          used in the development of all contemporary websites and web
          applications. These are the web's primary languages. Let's concentrate

      <h3>What is HTML?</h3>
      <p>
        <strong>H</strong>yperText <strong>M</strong>arkup
        <strong>L</strong>anguage, or HTML. Web developers use this markup
        language to organize and define the content of a webpage (not a
        programming language). Paragraphs, links, headers, photos, and videos
        are just a few of the components that make up HTML and define various
        forms of content. Web browsers can read HTML and display webpages made
        of HTML code.
      </p>
      <p>In HTML, each element is made up of 3 parts:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>The opening tag</li>
        <li>The closing tag</li>
        <li>The actual element</li>
      </ol>
      <p>

      <h3>Why to Learn HTML?</h3>
      <p>
        HTML was initially created with the goal of specifying the structure of
        documents, such as headers, paragraphs, lists, and other elements, to
        make it easier for academics to share scientific data. With the aid of
        the many tags offered by HTML, online pages are now often formatted
        using this language.
      </p>
      <p>
        Students and working professionals who want to become exceptional
        software engineers must be proficient in HTML, especially if they plan
        to work in the web development industry. Here are some of the main
        benefits of mastering HTML:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>

          can create a website or alter an existing web template.
        </li>
